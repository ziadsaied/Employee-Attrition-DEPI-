Employee Attrition Prediction and Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting employee attrition using machine learning techniques. By analyzing employee demographics, job roles, performance, salary, and other factors, the goal is to identify employees at risk of leaving and help organizations take proactive measures to improve retention and reduce turnover costs.

🎯 Objectives

Collect and preprocess employee data.

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key patterns.

Engineer features and apply statistical tests to improve predictions.

Train and optimize machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).

Deploy the final model with MLOps practices for real-time predictions.

Provide insights to HR for better retention strategies.

🗂️ Dataset

Source: Public datasets (e.g., Kaggle HR Analytics).

Features include demographics, job role, tenure, performance ratings, salary, and work-life balance.

🔧 Tech Stack

Languages/Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost

Deployment: Flask / FastAPI, Streamlit (optional)

MLOps: MLflow, DVC (optional)
